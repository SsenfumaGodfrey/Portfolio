**🧹 Dirty Data = Wrong Decisions.
Here’s why 80% of Data Science is just... cleaning.**
**Before the dashboards, before the models. . . . your data has to make sense.** 
- Yet many skip the most crucial step: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.

  - 🧩 Messy data = misleading insights.
  - 📉 Inconsistent data = broken algorithms.
  - 🤖 Even AI fails without clean input.


- Identified and ingested a "dirty" dataset containing over 3000 rows.
- Transformed raw, unstructured strings and inconsistent formats into a reliable source of truth for downstream analytics.
    - Standardizing Strings: Leveraged TRIM(), UPPER(), and INITCAP() to resolve inconsistent naming conventions and remove trailing white spaces.
    - Handling Nulls: Utilized COALESCE() and CASE statements to replace null values with "Unknown" or relevant defaults, ensuring $100\%$ row usability for reporting.
- Developed Common Table Expressions (CTEs) combined with ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY to identify and remove duplicate records without losing data integrity.
- Successfully eliminated 85% of duplicate entries, reducing storage overhead and preventing double-counting in sales reports.
- Improved data reliability by 100%, verified by comparing post-clean aggregate totals against raw source audits.
- Automated the cleaning pipeline with a reusable SQL script, reducing manual data preparation time from hours to seconds.
